## Basic Functionality
1. When the page first loads, the **"Name"** text field has the focus state by default to prompt the user.

2. The **"Other job role"** text field is hidden by default. It is displayed only when users select **"Other"** in the **"Job Role"** drop down menu, and is hidden if the user selects any other option.

3. The **"Color"** drop down menu is not available until the user chooses a design from the **"Design"** drop down menu. Once the user selects a design, the **"Color"** drop down menu becomes available and contains only colors associated with the selected design.

4. The **"Total: $"** element below the **"Register for Activities"** section updates to reflect the sum of the cost of the userâ€™s selected activities.

5. In the **"Payment Info"** section the **"Credit Card"** option is selected by default. The section updates based on the user's selection.
